microbe-web
===========

Microbe Web UI is a default web interface for [OpenIPC firmware][openipcfw].

Microbe Web is lightweight but powerful interface written mostly in shell
and [haserl][haserl]. Web UI listens on port 85.

### Muliti-language UI and Translation

To change the Web Interface language, please select Settings -> Web UI Settings
from the top menu, and then select your desired language from the dropdown list
in the form. Submit the form to save apply changes.

To add a missing language translation, please take a look at shell files in 
`/files/www/cgi-bin/locale/` directory. You might want to use `en.sh` file as a
template. It contains all the variables you need to assign proper values to.
Make a copy of that file, give the copy a name according to [ISO 639-1][iso639].

Language file is a shell script that starts with a shebang and followed by the
name of the language as a comment:
```
#!/bin/sh
#name:Klingonese
```

Below that header goes a list of variables and their values that constitute the
new language support. Update the values, test the new locale, then create a pull
request.

More documentation is available [in our wiki][wiki].
